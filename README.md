# üå± Leaving The Hill - Front End Projects
made by B√©reng√®re Carpentier, trainee @ üè¢ BeCode.

## What is it about ?
We're ending the Hills portion of our training, and before we start learning about the back-end, we were given 4 challenges to re-enforce our front-end skills.

# Challenge 4 - The Pomodoro Timer
A webpage where you can set a [Pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). The webpage should only display a **< button >** named "Start", when clicked, it should start a sequence.
